# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis
This project demonstrates an end-to-end churn analysis pipeline, combining data preparation in SQL, predictive modeling in Python, and interactive visualization in Power BI.

## 📁 Project Structure

├── Churn_Data.xlsx              # Original data exported from MySQL
├── New_Predictions.csv          # Model predictions for new joiners
├── Churn_Prediction.sql         # SQL scripts for ETL and data preparation

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze telecom customer churn behavior, build a predictive model to forecast churn risk for new joiners, and visualize the results in an interactive dashboard.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
MySQL: Data cleaning, preparation, and feature engineering

Python (scikit-learn): Model training and predictions

Power BI: Data visualization and reporting

## ⚙️ Workflow Overview
1️⃣ Data Preparation (SQL)
Created a dedicated database db_churn

Imported raw churn data from CSV

Cleaned and standardized the data:

Trimmed whitespace

Handled missing values with NULLIF() and IFNULL()

Labeled empty fields as None, No, or Others

Created a clean production table for visualization

Generated two SQL views:

Training View: Historical churn and stayed customers

Testing View: New joiners to predict churn risk

2️⃣ Machine Learning (Python)
Exported SQL views to Excel for processing

Trained a Random Forest Classifier using the training data

Predicted churn status for new joiners

Saved predictions to a CSV file

3️⃣ Data Visualization (Power BI)
Imported cleaned data and predictions

Created measures:

Total Customers

Total Churned Customers

Churn Rate

New Joiners

Added calculated columns:

Monthly Charge Range

Age Groups

Tenure Groups

Designed visuals:

Churn Rate by Demographics and Services

Top Churn Reasons

Slicers for filtering by Internet Type and Monthly Charges

Built interactive dashboards for exploration

## ✅ Key Results
Identified churn patterns by contract type, tenure, and demographics

Predicted churn risk for new customers

Delivered actionable dashboards to support business decisions
